        <b>Hi, parents &amp; guardians!</b>
        \n\n<p> Stuttering or disfluent speech occurs most often in children between the ages of 2 and 6 as they are developing their language skills. Approximately 5 to 10 percent of all children will stutter for some period in their life, lasting from a few weeks to several years (NIDCD, 2017).
        \n\n  Funpath is a fun and educational application to enhance the fluency and communication skills for your children. In collaboration with your child’s Speech-Language Pathologist/Speech Therapist, this app can be used to assess a child’s speech patterns to identify potential areas of stutter that need to be addressed. Funpath also includes games and exercises with target words and sentences selected by a Speech Therapist for your child to practice and promote fluency in speaking.
            \n\n For best results, consult a Speech-Language Pathologist/Speech Therapist on how to use Funpath for your child.</p>
